# Defects in Metal Surface Detection with Python

This repository contains an AI that recognizes and classifies defects in metal surface. To create it, I used python language with some libraries, and also a dataset found in Kaggle.

The dataset used was downloaded from the NEU Metal Surface Defects Databse, the link will available below. This contains six types of surface defects typical of hot rolled steel strip, namely rolled scale (RS), patches (Pa), cracks (Cr), perforated surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). The database includes 1800 grayscale images, 300 of which are samples of six different types of typical surface defects.

### üî®  How the script works?

### üèÉ  How to run this code?

If you want to run this script on your machine, first you need to make sure that all the libraries are installed, along with the Jupyter Notebook IDE, or another one of your choice.

After that, it is necessary to clone this repository, copy the command below, and paste it in your terminal (in the folder you prefer).
````
git clone https://github.com/wollieliza/metal-surface-defects-detection.git
````
Finally, you give the command to open jupyter:
````
jupyter notebook 
````
